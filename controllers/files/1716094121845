Sociological Thoughts 
1) - Auguste Comte
Father of sociology
Coined the word Sociology

Q.1) Law of Three Stages 
Ans.] - Law of Three Stages is a Theory of Transformation of society/ human race. From great apes to civilized society of present times. 
Theological  -> Metaphysical -> Positive
Theological stage (also called Fictitious stage)
- It is the earliest stage
- Greek word: Theology 
- THEOS (GOD) + OLOGY (OR LOGUS: STUDY OF A CERTAIN SUBJECT)
- It Explains that Events of nature is caused by divine forces/ super-natural beings
- The stage is dominated by priest & military
- The stage is further divided in three sub stages (3 levels of mental development of the theological stage)
1 -  Fetishism (Fetish[inanimate]+Ism) - Fetishism is the belief that inanimate objects have supernatural powers or spirits.
2 - Polytheism (Poly[many]+Thesis[religion]+Ism) - Polytheism is the belief in many gods or divine beings.
3 -  Monotheism (Mono [one]+Thesis[religion]+Ism) - Monotheism is the belief in one god or supreme being

Metaphysical Stage(Abstract Stage)
- This is the second stage
- The linking stage between theology and positive stage.
- Belief in supernatural power was replaced by rational thinking
- The metaphysical stage is the transitional stage, in which natural phenomena are explained by abstract concepts, such as essences, final causes, or form.
- Rationalism & Reasoning started growing.
- The stage corresponded to legalistic social organization

Positive Stage (Scientific Stage)
- It is the final and most advanced stage
- Natural Phenomenonas are explained by scientific laws based Authentic knowledge from actual experience.
- This stage fosters Industrial Society

Q.2.) Explain the theory of Positivsim ? 
- Positivism = Positive (science) + ism (philosophy)
- A science of philosophy – i.e. real, concrete, exact, scientific, rational, logical.
- It states The need to look at natural laws in order to study social phenomena.
-  Direct experience of reality is understood by unity of scientific method.

- There are 2 distinct nature of Comtean Positivism : -
1 : Positivism as a doctrine
• ‘Positivism’ – a way of thinking.
• It Claims that it is possible to study and observe social life and establish reliable, valid knowledge about how it works.
• Social science must use the method of physical science

2.Positivism as a method
• - It is the Application of scientific method.to understand social statics and social dynamics.
• - It uses Careful observation, indirect experimentation, comparison, historical method.
• - It states that Social life governed by certain laws that can be discovered by these methods.
• - Refuting reliance on religion or speculative metaphysical bases of knowledge

There are 3 main criticism to Positivism which are 
•Positivism is not influential in present times….why???
•Methodological gap between physical and social science
•Problem of verification

Q.3) - Discuss the Hierarchy of sciences?
- Hierarchy of sciences is proposed by auguste comte. 
- According to this theory the six sciences move from most simplest and general ones to the most complex and specific
Mathematics 
Astronomy
Physics
Chemistry 
Biology
Sociology
Morals 
Increasing Dpeendence of the Generality and Complexity

Q.4.) Diffence betweeen the social statics and social dynamics ? 
Ans.] - 
 •Social statics :
 - Studying the laws of action and reaction of different social system.
 - Studying the parts, that forms the whole
 - It examines how the different parts of a society work together to maintain social order and stability  
 - Social statics is the study of the structure and organization of a society at a given point in time

•Social dynamics: 
- How parts of societies are inter-related and how they have developed over time.
- Social dynamics is the study of the change and development of a society over time.
-  It explores how the different parts of a society interact and influence each other to produce social progress and transformation

Q.5) - Explain the religion to humanity? 
Ans - It is a secular religion which is proposed by auguste comte
 •Related to positive thinking
 •Religion Without God but based on Morality
 •Sociologists – Priest who constitute the moral guidelines

Emile Durkheim
He is known as the God Father of Sociology

Division of labour in the society
- It is an outcome of docotral work
- It suggests looking at the realtion between individual and society collectively - "social solidarity"
- "Concensus" varies between the simple and modern societies
- Norms and values in maintaining the cohesion also varies

Explain solidarity
- Solidarity Refers To The Condition Within A Social Group In Which There Is Social Cohesion Plus Cooperative, Collective Action Directed Towards The  Achievement Of Group Goals

Q.1) -TYPES OF SOLIDARITY ACCORDING TO DURKHEIM

- Mechanical Solidarity 
Solidarity based upon homogeneity of values and behaviour,strong social norms and kinship ties.It is often marked in small traditional societies with simple division of labour and Little Individuality.

-Organic Solidarity
Solidarity in modern industrial societies where unity arises from the interdependence of specialized individuals, characterized by complex division of labor and cooperation among diverse groups.


Q.2.) Write the difference between the mechanical and organic solidarity?

Mechanical Solidarity:
Based on resemblances.
Predominant in less advanced societies.
Segmental type with weak social bonds.
Low population and material/moral density.
Repressive sanctions, penal law.
High volume, intensity, determinateness in collective conscience.
Highly religious, transcendental, supreme value to society.

Organic Solidarity:
Based on division of labor.
Predominant in advanced, industrial societies.
Organized type with strong social bonds.
High population and material/moral density.
Restitutive sanctions, cooperative law.
Low volume, intensity, determinateness in collective conscience.
Secular, concerned with human interest, supreme value to individual dignity and social justice.


Q.3.) Write the difference between the repressive santions and restitutive sanctions
Repressive Sanctions:
Found in mechanical society.
Inflicts suffering on the criminal.
Informal and voice-uttered for implementation.
Punishment matches crime severity.
Law originates from unquestioned religious beliefs.

Restitutive Sanctions:
Found in organic society.
No punishment until legal solution.
Formal procedure for law implementation.
Aims at restoring pre-crime state, not punishment.
Cooperative law with opportunities for offender defense.

Q.4.) Transition from Mechanical to Organic Solidarity?
- Extreme division of labor leads to anomie, which is the counterpart of solidarity.
- It is characterized by normlessness and clash of values.
- Anomie results in feelings of individualism, detachment, disorganization, and disintegration.
- Anomic division of labor exacerbates the breakdown of social cohesion and solidarity.

THREE WAYS OF DIVISION OF LABOUR
• Technical division of labour
• Sexual division of labour
• Social division of labour

Solidarity among individual and society 

Rules of Sociological Method
Aim A: To define the nature of sociological subject matter and acknowledge social realities beyond individual experiences.
Aim B: To establish and follow the steps of sociological investigations using scientific methods.

AIM A : Subject-Matter of Sociology - Study of Social Facts:
- Social facts are every way of acting fixed or not, capable of executing on individual an external constraint.
EXAMPLE: values, cultural norms and social structures.

Characteristics of social facts
Externality: Social facts are external to individuals and can be treated as objective entities.
Constraint: They have the capability to exert legal and moral constraints on individuals.
Generality: Social facts are universally applicable across societies.
Independence: They are independent of the personal features of individuals.

AIM B : TO SET OUT THE STEPS OF SOCIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND INVESTIGATE THEM BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS
1 - Rules of observation
2 - Rules for distinguishing between normal and pathological social facts
3 - Rules for classifying societies
4 - Rules for explanation of social facts
5 - Rues for testing sociological explanations for establishing sociological proofs 

Q.5) - Write a short note on suicides ? Explain the two major reasons behind the suicides ? Explain the types of suicides ? 
Ans]- 
Suicide
Every case of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act 
performed by the victim himself and which strives to produce this result
• The act of taking one’s own life…. Conscious act and a social fact…
• A pathological situation…. Or anomie….
• An indication of disorganization of society…death of solidarity…

Reasons behind suicide:
- Suicide is not solely an individual act but influenced by broader social conditions.
Extra-social factors are disregarded in understanding suicide causes.
Social conditions, including an individual's integration into and regulation within society, play a significant role.
Social integration refers to the strength of social bonds between individuals and society.
Social regulation pertains to the constraints on individual actions and desires by moral 
values.

There are total 4 types of suicide which are :-
Types of Suicide:
- Egoistic: Arises from weak social integration, leading to feelings of detachment and alienation, e.g., suicide by unmarried or widowed individuals.
- Altruistic: Arises from strong social integration, where individuals sacrifice for a cause or ideal, e.g., self-homicide by an army squad.
- Anomic: Arises from weak social regulation due to breakdown of norms or sudden changes, e.g., farmer's suicide during economic crises.
- Fatalistic: Arises from strong social regulation, such as in cases of slavery or bonded labor.

Q.6) - Explain about the Elementary Forms of religiuos Life ?

Church:
A place where people gather for religious activities.

ROLE OF RELIGION (FROM HIS STUDY OF TOTEMISM OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINS)
Totem: a common object such as a animal or a plant and a symbol representing that it is sacred

The characteristics of Totem are 
- Worshiping the totem equates to worshiping one's own society.
- Sharing beliefs and practices fosters collective conscience during gatherings.
- Transmission of beliefs and practices from one generation to the next.
- Religion disciplines followers by maintaining taboos, prohibitions, and punishments for violators
- Provides help and comfort to those in distress and crises.

Relevance of Ideal Types:

TO CONSTRUCT HYPOTHESIS .
Serving as theoretical tool TO UNDERSTAND REALITY AND SUBJECT-MATTER CLEARLY .
Classifying phenomena into categories for prediction.
Source for construction of concepts.
Tool for making comparative studies.

Q.3) - Explain the Versthen and its types ? 
Ans - Verstehen, derived from the German word meaning "to understand," refers to a meaningful understanding of something, particularly the way groups construct their reality and the meaning they attribute to their actions.

1 - Aktuelles Verstehen (Direct Observational Understanding): Involves simply observing and describing people's actions without interpreting motives.

Karl Marx

Q.1) - Explain the Historical and Dielactical Materialism ? 
Ans] - 
Historical Materialism:
1 - Materialistic interpretation of history based on Marx's analysis of societal divisions and economic determinism.
2 - Economically determined base (economy) influences the superstructure (all other societal relations).
Class divisions in historical progression: Primitive Communism, Slavery, Feudalism, Capitalism.

Dialectical Materialism:
Borrowed dialectics from Hegel, emphasizing understanding contradictions in society.
Dialectical Idealism: Consciousness determines being.
Dialectical Materialism: Being determines consciousness, focusing on material conditions of society.

2. Self Control : It involves self control such as Learning to obey Societal Taboos eg. Incest is generally considered as a taboo in the society 
3. Indoctrination : It includes indoctrination where individuals are taught certain beliefs or principles. 
4. Development of Individuality: It leads to the development of individuality, as we form our unique identities within the context of our society. 

Socialisation is a form Learning 
1 - To Discriminate : Learning to Distinguish and differentiate between different stimuli,situations and context.
2 - Reward and Punishment : Learning from the consequences of actions where the positive behaviours are reinforced by rewards and the negative behaviors are discouraged with punishment 
3 - Control frustation :  Learning to manage and copewith frustation, which is important part of social interaction and relationship.

Types of socialisation 
1. Primary Socialization: This is the initial stage where an individual begins to absorb the norms and values of society, typically occurring during childhood.
2. Anticipatory Socialization: This stage involves learning and preparing for future roles and expectations in society.
3. Developmental Socialization: This process continues throughout life as individuals adapt and grow within their roles and social environments.
4. Re-Socialization: This occurs when there is a significant shift in one’s life that requires them to learn new norms and values, such as entering a new profession or adapting to a new culture.

Stages of Socialisation

1. Oral Stage: Babies learn who to trust as they feed and bond with caregivers.(Primary Identification)
2 - Anal Stage: Occuring Between the ages of 1-3.Toddlers gain independence by learning to control their body functions.
3 - Oedipal Stage: (4-13 years) Kids form emotional bonds and see themselves in the parent of the same gender.

Mead classified self into two categories which is 
I - It is the spontaneous autonomous part of self.
we - It represents the internalised expectations of attitudes within the society.
-> Interaction → Awareness: Through interaction with others, individuals become aware of themselves.
-> Role-Playing: Mead suggested that children develop their sense of self through a process of role-playing, where they take on the roles of others and see themselves from the perspective of those others.
-> Significant Others: These are individuals who have a significant impact on an individual’s life, such as parents or close friends, and play a major role in shaping one’s self-concept
-> Generalised Others : This meads idea Suggest the we learn society's rules by observing common behaviours and expectations of the group as a whole.


-> Self is a Product of Social Interaction: Mead stated that the self is not there at birth but emerges through social interaction. It is the dynamic process of social experiences and activities that construct the self.


5th Module : Social Mobility and Change 

Differentiation and Stratification in the society 

- Differentiation is about recognizing and categorizing people based on characteristics like age, sex, occupation, personal characteristics.
- Stratification process by which individuals and groups are ranked in a more or less enduring hierarchy of status.Societies often arrange members based on perceived superiority, inferiority, and equality, which involves comparing and ranking individuals, differentiating them by their roles, and evaluating these roles differently. This process, known as social stratification, can affect access to resources and opportunities.

Difference in various fields like Possesion , Quality , Performance Leads to social Stratification
a.) Possesion : People with more resources can access better opportunities, leading to differences in social status. 
b.) Quality : Perceived quality of work or products can affect a person’s reputation and opportunities.
c.) Performance : Higher performance often leads to better job prospects and social recognition.

Social Stratification 
1 - Ogburn and Nimkoff : Stratification process by which individuals and groups are ranked in a more or less enduring hierarchy of status.
2 - Gisbert : Division of society into permanent groups of categories linked with each other by relationship of superiority and subordination.

Social stratification has 5 key attributes:
- Social: It’s a societal system that ranks individuals and groups.
- Ancient: The concept has existed throughout human history.
- Universal: Every society has some form of stratification.
- Diverse: It varies greatly across different societies and cultures.
- Consequential: It significantly affects people’s lifestyles.

Origin of Stratification 

2 Theories are been proposed 
1.] Economic Determinism / Conflict Theory : This theory states that society’s structure is based on economic class struggles and power battles.

2.] - Functionalist Theory: It sees society as a system where every part, including social stratification, works to keep society stable by placing skilled individuals in key roles.

Pitirim Sorokin: He believed that the environment shapes how individuals adapt and function within their society.

Kingsley Davis: He proposed that social stratification is essential for placing the most capable people in significant roles, ensuring society runs smoothly.

Functions of Stratification
1 - Encourages Hardwork.
2 - Ensures Circulation of Elites.
3 - Serves as Economic Function.
4 - Prevents the waste of resources.
5 - Stabalises and reinforces attitudes and skills.
6 - Helps to pursure different proffessions and job.
7 - Social Control.
8 - Controlling Effect on the shady world. 

Types of stratification 
Social Stratification is divided into two categories
1 - Caste Stratification (Closed System - An immobile Society) : A closed system where social status is determined by birth and is immutable.
2 - Class Stratification (Open System - A Mobile Society) :  An open system that allows for social mobility. Here, individuals can change their social status through education, occupation, and other achievements.

Stratification is closely associated with (6 things)
 a. Equality
 b. Inequality
 c. Hierarchy
 d. Exclusion
 e. Poverty
 f. Deprivation

- Inequality: It creates layers within society where some have more access to resources and opportunities than others.
- Hierarchy: It establishes a ranking system among different social categories.
- Exclusion: Certain groups may be systematically disadvantaged or marginalized.
- Poverty: It can be both a cause and a consequence of stratification.
- Deprivation: Individuals or groups may lack necessities and opportunities due to their position in the social hierarchy.

Equality and Inequality 
Equality : The State of begin Equal in some respect 
 a. Political equality
 b. Fair distribution of income and wealth
 c. Equality of public expenditure
 d. Equality of final income
 e. Equality of use
 f. Equality of opportunity
 g. Equlaity of outcome 

Inequality: existence of unequal opportunities and rewards in different positions or status within a social group.

- A Result of Differentiation: Differences arise from distinguishing and categorizing people.
- Universal: Inequality exists in every society.
- Built into Social Structure: It’s an inherent part of how societies are organized.
- Source of Social Conflict and Change Sustained by thr power of Ideas: Disparities can lead to disagreements and societal evolution.
- Not Necessarily Based on Power of Ideas: It can exist independently of ideological influences.

Hierarchy
- Hierarchy :  Any relationship of individuals, groups, or classes involving a system of ranking.
- Hierarchy is to trace out the realtive position or status of an individual or group.

Brahmins 
Ksatriyas
Vaishyas 
Shudras
Dalits

Exclusion 
 - A process by which individuals or households experience deprivation, either of resources such as income or of social links to the wider community or society

Features of Exclusion 
a. Depriviation of opportunities 
b. Not accidental 
c. Involuntary 
d. Prolonged and thus leading to demand for inclusion.

Exlcution of Often seem overlapping with 
a. Social rights 
b. Social Isolation
c. Marginalised 



- Absolute Deprivation: This is about not having the essential resources needed to survive, like food and shelter.
- Relative Deprivation: This is feeling deprived compared to others or what one believes they deserve, even if basic needs are met.


Social Mobility : 
Pitirim A. Sorokin: Introduced the concept in his book “Social and Cultural Mobility.”
WPScott :  The movement of an individual or group from one social class or stratum to another. The shift can either be higher, lower, inter-generational, or intra-generational, and it cannot necessarily be determined if the change is for good or bad.

- University Education 
- Hypergamy
- Backruptcy
- Economic Crisis

Factors that promote social Mobility 
1. Education 
2. Occupation and Economic Activities 
3. Religious Institutions 
4. Political Institutions
5. Family and Marriadge

What is the extent of mobility and who determines it... ?? 
Determinants : 
Amount of Mobility and Conditions of Mobility

Social Structure 
Talcott Parsons :The term social structure applies to the particular arrangement of the interrelated institutions, agencies and social patterns as well as the  statuses and roles which each person assumes in the group.


According to Maclver and Page the various modes of grouping together comprise the  complex pattern of the social structure. They have also regarded that social structure is  abstract which is composed of several groups like family, church, class, caste, state or  community etc.

ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE
